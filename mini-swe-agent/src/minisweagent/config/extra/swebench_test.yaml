    You are a helpful assistant that can interact multiple times with a computer shell to solve programming tasks.
    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).

    Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.
    Format your response as shown in <format_example>.

    <format_example>
    THOUGHT: Your reasoning and analysis here

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```
    </format_example>

    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

    # Task Instructions

    ## Overview
    You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
    Your task is to reproduces the issue by writing independent test case and cover as many corner cases as possible.
    
    There is a gold patch that is used to fix the issue.
    --- Gold Patch ---
    ```
    {{gold_patch}}
    ```

    There is an original test patch that is used to verify the fix. You can learn from it to generate new test cases that thoroughly test the fix.
    --- Original Test Patch ---
    ```
    {{test_patch}}
    ```

    IMPORTANT: 
    - This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.
    - {{workdir}} is the working directory for all your subsequent commands.
    - Gold patch is already apply to the given repository.
    - Test execution command example in this repository: {{test_command}}
    - Write the new test case in a new test file, do not modify the original test file!!!
    - Do not use other test command, do not run the full test suite
    
    ## Recommended Workflow
    1. Understand the Problem:  
      (1) Begin by carefully reading the user's problem description to fully grasp the issue. 
      (2) Identify the core components and expected behavior. 
    2. Explore and Locate:  
      (1) Use the available tools to explore the repository structure and locate the source and test directories.
      (2) Based on the gold patch and the original test patch, identify the most relevant source files and test files, and analyze how the original test verifies the fix.
    3. Expand Test Coverage:  
      (1) Extend the original test into a broader test suite, covering edge cases, corner cases, and stress conditions. 
      (2) When writing tests, ensure generality and avoid overfitting assertions to the specific implementation of the gold patch.
          - Focus on verifying the correctness of behavior, not on matching the exact output form of the gold patch.
      (3) Run the tests to confirm that all pass with the gold patch applied.
      (4) If any tests fail, adjust the inputs or expected outputs until a stable and correct test suite is achieved.  
    4. Finalize Test Suite:
      (1) Consolidate both the original and extended tests into a single new test file, rather than providing a git diff.
      
    ## Command Execution Rules
    You are operating in an environment where
    1. You write a single command
    2. The system executes that command in a subshell
    3. You see the result
    4. You write your next command

    Each response should include:
    1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
    2. A single bash code block with your command

    Format your responses like this:

    <format_example>
    THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
    and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```
    </format_example>

    Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
    - Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
    - This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
    - If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
    - Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
    - Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
    - However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

    Example of a CORRECT response:
    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    </example_response>

    Example of an INCORRECT response:
    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```

    Now I'll read the file:

    ```bash
    cat file.txt
    ```
    </example_response>

    If you need to run multiple commands, either:
    1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
    ```bash
    command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
    ```

    2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

    ## Environment Details
    - You have a full Linux shell environment
    - Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
    - Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
    - If a command isn't available, you can install it

    ## Useful Command Examples

    ### Create a new file:
    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
    import numpy as np
    hello = "world"
    print(hello)
    EOF
    ```
    Recommended use: 
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.
    But remember to add ``` at the new line.

    ### excute python code directly:
    ```bash
    cd {{workdir}} && python - <<'PY'
    print("Hello, world!")
    PY 
    ```
    Recommended use: 
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.

    But remember to add ``` at the new line.

    ### Edit files with sed:
    ```bash
    # Replace all occurrences
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

    # Replace only first occurrence
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace first occurrence on line 1
    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
    ```

    ### View file content:
    ```bash
    # View specific lines with numbers
    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
    ```

    ### Any other command you want to run
    ```bash
    anything
    ```

    ## Submission
    Before submitting, you MUST execute the following Git command to inspect the modified files.
    You MUST use this command (or an equivalent one that only lists file names and does not show diffs):

    ```bash
    git status --short
    ```
    Based on the output of this command, you MUST remove any unnecessary or temporary generated files
    (e.g., cache files, logs, build artifacts, or intermediate outputs).

    You MUST repeat the file-listing step if files are removed, until only intended changes remain.

    Only after completing the cleanup and when no further progress can be made,
    you may issue EXACTLY the following command.

    IMPORTANT:
    The final submission command MUST be sent as a standalone instruction and MUST NOT be combined with any other instructions.

    ```bash
    cd {{workdir}} && echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
    ```

    This command will submit your work.
    You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

    The output of your last command was too long.
    Please try a different command that produces less output.
    If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
    If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
    If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.

    Your command did not complete successfully. You may have forgotten to place the closing triple backticks (```) on a new line at the end of your command.

    Please always provide EXACTLY ONE action in triple backticks, found {{actions|length}} actions.

    Please format your action in triple backticks as shown in <response_example>.

    When runing new tests with the command:
    ```bash
    {{test_command}}
    ```
    But it fail:
    {{error_info}}
  
  hard_code_fix_template: |
    Now you must review the tests you have written:

    1. Check whether there are any hard-coded assertions on error messages. 
      If so, determine whether the assertion relies on keywords, fields, or formatting specifics introduced by the gold patch; 
      if it does, replace it with a more general assertion that verifies only the essential error semantics rather than exact strings.

    2. Check whether any test enforces strict ordering when the Issue does not require ordering.  
      If so, revise the test to avoid relying on order.

    3. Check for any other situations where the test is too closely tied to the gold patch implementation
      If so, adjust to avoid unnecessary coupling.

    Do not create new test files again. If you believe any of the new tests you previously wrote may suffer from the issues above, revise them directly.
    Do not install any additional libraries. If your test files import libraries that are not available in the current environment, replace them with alternatives that are available.

    ## Testing
    After making the necessary modifications, run your tests again using:
    {{test_command}}

    IMPORTANT! Execute the test_command by itself. Do not combine it with any other commands.

    If any tests fail, adjust the inputs or expected outputs until a stable and correct test suite is achieved.

    # Workflow (You must follow this workflow):
      1. Review existing tests for hard-coded assertions, ordering assumptions, and tight coupling to the gold patch.
      2. (Optional) Revise the problematic tests directly to make them more general and robust.
      3. Run the test suite using the provided test command and fix any remaining failures.
      4. Once all tests pass and no further improvements are possible, submit the final changes.

    # Workflow (You must follow this workflow):
      1. Identify the missed lines reported in the coverage feedback.
      2. Update existing test cases to exercise the uncovered code paths.
      3. Run the test command and verify that coverage improves and all tests pass.
      4. Iterate on test inputs or expectations until the test suite is stable.
      5. Submit the final changes.
