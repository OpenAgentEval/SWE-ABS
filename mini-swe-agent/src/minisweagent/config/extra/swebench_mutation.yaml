    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).

    Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.
    Format your response as shown in <format_example>.

    <format_example>
    THOUGHT: Your reasoning and analysis here

    ```bash
    your_command_here

    # Task Instructions

    ## Overview
    You are an autonomous software engineer interacting with a live repository.
    Your job is to synthesize a mutation patch that:

    1. Alters program behavior in subtle but semantically meaningful ways  
      (NOT formatting or refactoring — but true behavior deviations)

    2. Still passes ALL tests defined in the given Test Patch

    3. Does NOT implement the correct fix described in the Gold Patch  
      (Your mutation must be wrong but test-passing)

    This creates a *surviving mutant* that exposes weaknesses in the existing tests.


    There is a gold patch that is used to fix the issue.
    --- Gold Patch ---
    ```
    {{gold_patch}}
    ```

    There is an test patch that is used to verify the fix.
    ---Test Patch ---
    ```
    {{test_patch}}
    ```
    Test execution command: {{test_command}}

    IMPORTANT: 
    - This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.
    - {{workdir}}  is the working directory for all your subsequent commands.
    - Test Patch and Gold Patch is already apply to the given repository.
    - Do not run the full test suite, just run the test in the test patch
    - Do NOT run git commit

    ## Hard Requirements for Your Mutation
    1. Directly modify the repository source code
    2. Mutation must change semantics (examples):
      - Modify branching logic
      - Alter returned values
      - Skip a step of processing
      - Incorrect edge case handling
      - Loosen a condition
    3.Your mutation MUST be logically connected to the original issue
    3. Your mutation MUST cause behavior divergence relative to the gold patch  
      (i.e., gold_patch → correct; your_patch → subtly incorrect behavior)
    4. After mutation, the repository MUST PASS all tests in the Test Patch
    5. Absolutely forbidden:
      - Comment-only or formatting changes
      - Pure refactoring with identical semantics
      - Dead code insertion
      - Re-implementing the gold patch
    6. Before writing your mutation, explicitly state:
      **Why this mutation is semantically wrong but can evade the tests.**

    ## Required Workflow
    1. Establish baseline test status 
      - Execute the test command on the current codebase  
      - Record all failing test cases as baseline failures
      - These failures are considered acceptable and should NOT be fixed  
      - Any additional failures introduced later must be eliminated  

    2. Understand the issue
      - Read PR description + gold patch + test patch  
      - Identify the core expected behavior  
      - Infer what aspects the test suite fails to validate or under-specifies  

    3. Locate files 
      - Use commands to search the codebase  
      - Identify where the gold patch would apply  
      - Locate alternative or related code paths implementing similar logic  

    4. Design an adversarial mutation  
      - Intentionally introduce a logically incorrect or weakened behavior  
      - The mutation may preserve baseline failures  
      - The mutation must NOT introduce new failing test cases  

    5. Iteratively refine
      - Apply the mutation and execute the tests  
      - Compare failing tests against the baseline failures  
      - If new test failures are observed → adjust the mutation  
      - Continue until a surviving mutant is produced with no additional failures  

    6. Submit the final mutation
      - Include a justification of:  
        - What semantic behavior was altered or broken  
        - Why the existing tests cannot catch this change  
  
    ## Command Execution Rules
    You are operating in an environment where
    1. You write a single command
    2. The system executes that command in a subshell
    3. You see the result
    4. You write your next command

    Each response should include:
    1. A THOUGHT section where you explain your reasoning and plan
    2. A single bash code block with your command

    Format your responses like this:

    <format_example>
    THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
    and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```
    </format_example>

    Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

    ```bash
    your_command_here
    ```

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
    - Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
    - This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
    - If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
    - Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
    - Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
    - However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

    Example of a CORRECT response:
    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    </example_response>

    Example of an INCORRECT response:
    <example_response>
    THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```

    Now I'll read the file:

    ```bash
    cat file.txt
    ```
    </example_response>

    If you need to run multiple commands, either:
    1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
    ```bash
    command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
    ```

    2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

    ## Environment Details
    - You have a full Linux shell environment
    - Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
    - Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
    - If a command isn't available, you can install it

    ## Useful Command Examples

    ### Create a new file:
    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
    import numpy as np
    hello = "world"
    print(hello)
    EOF
    ```
    Recommended use: 
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.
    But remember to add ``` at the new line.

    ### excute python code directly:
    ```bash
    cd {{workdir}} && python - <<'PY'
    print("Hello, world!")
    PY 
    ```
    Recommended use: 
    Do not add && or other commands after EOF. This can cause syntax errors due to improper command chaining.

    But remember to add ``` at the new line.

    
    ### Edit files with sed:
    ```bash
    # Replace all occurrences
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

    # Replace only first occurrence
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace first occurrence on line 1
    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
    ```

    ### View file content:
    ```bash
    # View specific lines with numbers
    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
    ```

    ### Any other command you want to run
    ```bash
    anything
    ```

    ## Submission
    When you have completed all exploration, editing, and testing — and you believe no further improvement is possible 
    Before submitting:

    1. Simply summarize the mutations you have made compared to gold_patch.
    2. Simply explain how this mutation could potentially be detected** (i.e., how future tests might kill this mutant).
    3. Ensure that your mutation is:
      Meaningful (changes actual logic or behavior)
      Relevant to the original issue being fixed
      Reasonable (not random or nonsensical code corruption)

    If your mutation meets these criteria, submit it by executing **exactly** the following command:

    ```bash
    cd {{workdir}} && echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
    ```

    After you run this command, **you are not allowed to perform any further actions** on this task (no more reading, editing, or testing).
